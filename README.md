# Secure Payment Application Demonstration

Here (in all it's glory) is my final year project, which I did as part of my *BSc in Computer Science*, while
attending *University College of Cork* from 2009-2014, here in Ireland.
This has been recovered from a zip file found on my DropBox account. I say recovered, because I do not think it is quite what it used to be.

I have cleverly tried to preserve the development process and trail of thought by committing
my archived folders (Prototype1, Prototype2, etc..) sequentially. In this process I am sure we lost many of the functionality that was once there.

One day I would like to come back to this and fix it up for the world to see. But until that day, this is what you get.


## What is it?

The main goal of this project was to build an application which can easily
demonstrate attacks, and the corresponding countermeasures which help defend against these attacks.
These countermeasures have the  ability to  be enabled and disabled  on  demand,
and  the different attacks can be easily demonstrated.

A catalogue of countermeasures was also
compiled which contains all the necessary information on each countermeasure implemented.


## Can I see the end product?

Sure. Unfortunately I don't have it set up anywhere at the moment. Yo could attempt to run it locally, but I don't have a clear,
defined set of instructions that would allow you to easily do this. I apologise.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you would have any interest in a demo, or the accompanying report that I produced.
